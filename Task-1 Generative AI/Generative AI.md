## 🧠✨ **What is Generative AI?**

---

### 📘 **Introduction**

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) refers to a branch of AI that can **create new content** such as ✍️ text, 🖼️ images, 🎵 music, 🎬 video, and 💻 code. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on recognition and prediction, **Generative AI creates**.

---

### 🧾 **Definition**

Generative AI is a **machine learning technology** that learns from large datasets and produces original outputs that resemble human-created data.

> Think of it as an artist 🤖 who learns by studying millions of artworks and then paints new ones!

---

### 🔧 **How Does Generative AI Work?**

It uses models like:

* **🤖 Transformers** (e.g., GPT, BERT) – for text.
* **🧬 GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** – for images and videos.
